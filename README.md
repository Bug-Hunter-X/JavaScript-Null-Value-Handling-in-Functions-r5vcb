# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript related to handling null values within functions.  The `bug.js` file shows a basic function that adds two numbers but doesn't robustly handle the case where one or both inputs are null.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, improves the function's error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and maintain program integrity.  This example highlights best practices for handling potential null or undefined values, crucial for preventing runtime crashes and ensuring predictable function behavior.
